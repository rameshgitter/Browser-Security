# LeetCode Local Test-Case Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A zero-dependency, single-file HTML tool that instantly generates a C++ boilerplate for any LeetCode problem, complete with all example test cases, ready for local development and testing.

Stop wasting precious time during contests setting up files, includes, and `main` functions. Just paste the page source and get a ready-to-compile C++ file in one click.

## Features

-   **Instant Boilerplate:** Generates a complete C++ file from a LeetCode problem's page source.
-   **Auto Test Cases:** Automatically parses and includes all example test cases from the problem description.
-   **Contest-Style Environment:**
    -   Simulates `Accepted`, `Wrong Answer`, and `Time Limit Exceeded` verdicts.
    -   Measures and prints the execution time for each test case.
-   **Smart Parsing:** Intelligently extracts the function signature (name, parameters, return type) from the page's metadata.
-   **Helper Utilities:** Includes helper functions for parsing common LeetCode input formats (e.g., string `"[1,2,3]"` to `vector<int>`).
-   **Zero Installation:** It's a single `leetcoder.html` file. No dependencies, no build steps. Just open it in your browser.
-   **Competitive Programming Style:** Uses `<bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;` for fast and clean coding.

## How to Use

**Step 1: Save the Tool**
Download the `leetcoder.html` file from this repository to your local machine.

**Step 2: Open in Browser**
Double-click the `leetcoder.html` file to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

**Step 3: Get LeetCode Page Source**
1.  Navigate to the LeetCode problem you want to solve.
2.  Right-click anywhere on the page and select **"View Page Source"**.
3.  A new tab will open with the page's HTML. Press **`Ctrl + A`** to select all text, then **`Ctrl + C`** to copy it.

**Step 4: Generate the Code**
1.  Go back to the `leetcoder.html` browser tab.
2.  Paste (**`Ctrl + V`**) the copied source code into the large text area.
3.  Click the **"Generate C++ Boilerplate"** button.

**Step 5: Compile and Run**
1.  Your ready-to-use C++ code will appear at the bottom. Click the **"Copy"** button.
2.  Paste the code into a new file (e.g., `solution.cpp`).
3.  Open your terminal, navigate to the file's directory, and run:

    ```bash
    # Compile with C++17 and optimization, then run the executable
    g++ -std=c++17 -O2 solution.cpp -o solution && ./solution
    ```

## Example Generated Output

For the problem [3578. Count Partitions With Max-Min Difference at Most K](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-max-min-difference-at-most-k/), the tool generates the following file:

```cpp
// Generated by LeetCoder for: Count Partitions With Max-Min Difference at Most K
// Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-max-min-difference-at-most-k/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// --- Helper Functions ---
// ... (trim, parseVectorInt, printVector) ...

class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(const vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Your code here
        
        return 0;
    }
};

// --- Main Function for Local Testing ---
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    const int TIME_LIMIT_MS = 1000; // 1 second

    // --- Test Case 1 ---
    {
        cout << "\n--- Test Case 1 ---" << endl;
        string nums1_str = R"([9,4,1,3,7])";
        vector<int> nums1 = parseVectorInt(nums1_str);
        int k1 = 4;
        int expected1 = 6;

        auto start_time = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        int result = sol.countPartitions(nums1, k1);
        auto end_time = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto duration = chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(end_time - start_time);

        cout << "Execution time: " << duration.count() << " ms" << endl;

        if (duration.count() > TIME_LIMIT_MS) {
            cout << "Status: Time Limit Exceeded" << endl;
        } else if (result == expected1) {
            cout << "Status: Accepted" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Status: Wrong Answer" << endl;
            cout << "Output:   " << result << endl;
            cout << "Expected: " << expected1 << endl;
        }
    }

    // --- Test Case 2 ---
    {
        // ... (similar structure for the second test case) ...
    }

    return 0;
}
```
